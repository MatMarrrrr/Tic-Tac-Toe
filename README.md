## Project Description
This is a tic-tac-toe game developed in React. Players 'X' and 'O' alternate turns on a three-by-three grid. The game intelligently determines the winner or a tie based on the state of the board after each move. It features a modal that declares the outcome and allows for a game restart. The game state, including the current player and game status, is effectively managed and updated throughout the gameplay, providing a smooth user experience.
